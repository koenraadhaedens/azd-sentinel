# Azure Sentinel with sample Data Connectors
Deploys a Log Analytics Workspace for Azure Sentinel, including 4 sample data connectors/content hub solutions:
- Amazon Web Services
- Entra ID
- M365
- Azure Logic Apps

This repo contains an AZD template which deploys Azure Sentinel. The scenario can be deployed to Azure using the [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview). 

üí™ This template scenario is part of the larger **[Microsoft Trainer Demo Deploy Catalog](https://aka.ms/trainer-demo-deploy)**.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
- [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
    - When installing AZD, the above the following tools will be installed on your machine as well, if not already installed:
        - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
        - [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
    - You need Owner or Contributor access permissions to an Azure Subscription to  deploy the scenario.

## üöÄ Deploying the scenario in 4 steps:

1. Create a new folder on your machine.
```
mkdir petender/azd-sentinel
```
2. Next, navigate to the new folder.
```
cd petender/azd-sentinel
```
3. Next, run `azd init` to initialize the deployment.
```
azd init -t petender/azd-sentinel
```
4. Last, run `azd up` to trigger an actual deployment.
```
azd up
```

‚è© Note: you can delete the deployed scenario from the Azure Portal, or by running ```azd down --purge --force``` from within the initiated folder. The 'purge' parameter will remove any resources who would typically be kept in a soft-delete status.
